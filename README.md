# dotfiles

Information about my dotfiles.

## Font

I use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) everywhere.
Point size is 12.
(I actually use it patched from
[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).)

## Default terminal size

My requirements are:
- at least 80x25 so that it fits
  [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) together with the
  [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/).
- at least 93x29 so that a Vim session contains at least 80x24 lines of text
  (some of the screen is filled by status lines and minimap).
- at least Nx35 for a given N, so that a Vim session contains at least 30
  lines, the same number of lines as a ruled Moleskine notebook.
