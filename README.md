# dotfiles

Information about my dotfiles.

## Font

I use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) everywhere.
Point size is 12.
(I actually use it patched from
[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).)

## Default terminal size

I use at least 80x25 so that it fits
[neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) together with the
[starship prompt](https://starship.rs/).
